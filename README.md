## Description
In this project I worked with a search field that listens to the user's input and makes an API call to get a suggestion of top 5 location the user might be looking for. Once the user submits the search I will make another api call and get the weather data to the selected location.

## 3rd party API
In this project I am using 3rd party api that hold all the weather data that I need to this weather application. (https://openweathermap.org)
